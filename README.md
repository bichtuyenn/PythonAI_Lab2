Q1 Write a program to draw the scatter plot of the data D and sin function for the range 0≤𝑥𝑥 ≤6,and generate a graph. 
Submit the program and the generated graph to the Teams, with the points of the scatter plot in red and the sin function in green.
※Right-click on the output image and select "Save Image As..." to save the image. You can copy the image by clicking "Copy Image".
※The sin function can be calculated using np.sin(x).※The color can be specified as red with color="red" or green with color="green".
※The following is a sample of the reference answer. (You do not need to add the word "Sample" to the graph you submit.

Q2    Write a gradient descent method program to find the parameters a, b, c, and d of the cubic function 𝑦𝑦=𝑎𝑎𝑥𝑥3+𝑏𝑏𝑥𝑥2+𝑐𝑐𝑥𝑥+𝑑𝑑  from  the  data  𝐷𝐷. 
Generate  a  scatter  plot  of  the  data  𝐷𝐷  for  the  range  0≤𝑥𝑥 ≤6and a graph showing the sin function and the cubic function.
Submit the program and graph to the Teams. Points in the scatter plot should be in red, the sin function in green, and the cubic function in blue.
※When you set the learning rate to 0.000008 and the parameters are updated about 200,000 times, you will get a good function.
※The color can be specified as blue with color="blue".
※The following is a sample of the reference answer. 
(You do not need to add the word "Sample" to the graph you submit.)

Q3    Consider  a  learning  method  using  the  analytical  solution  of  the  least-squares  method  to  find  parameters for data 𝐷𝐷.
Answer the following (a) and (b).
(a) Write  a  learning  method  program  using  the  least-squares  analytical  solution  to  find  the 
parameters  𝑤𝑤0,𝑤𝑤1,𝑤𝑤2,𝑤𝑤3  of the cubic function𝑦𝑦=𝑤𝑤0+𝑤𝑤1𝑥𝑥+𝑤𝑤2𝑥𝑥2+𝑤𝑤3𝑥𝑥3  from the data 𝐷𝐷, and generate a graph drawing scatterplot
of the data 𝐷𝐷, the sin function and cubic function for the range 0≤𝑥𝑥 ≤6.   Submit the program and graph to Teams. Points in the scatter 
plot should be in red, the sin function in green, and the cubic function in blue.
※The following is a sample of the reference answer. 
(You do not need to add the word "Sample" to the graph you submit.)
(b) Write  a  learning  method  program  using  the  least-squares  analytical  solution  to  find  the  parameters 
𝑤𝑤0,𝑤𝑤1,𝑤𝑤2,𝑤𝑤3,𝑤𝑤4,𝑤𝑤5,𝑤𝑤6,𝑤𝑤7,𝑤𝑤8,𝑤𝑤9  of the  ninth-order  function 𝑦𝑦=𝑤𝑤0+𝑤𝑤1𝑥𝑥+𝑤𝑤2𝑥𝑥2+𝑤𝑤3𝑥𝑥3+𝑤𝑤4𝑥𝑥4+𝑤𝑤5𝑥𝑥5+𝑤𝑤6𝑥𝑥6+𝑤𝑤7𝑥𝑥7+𝑤𝑤8𝑥𝑥8+𝑤𝑤9𝑥𝑥9 
from the data 𝐷𝐷, and generate a graph drawing scatterplot of the data 𝐷𝐷, the sin function and the ninth-order function for the range 0≤𝑥𝑥 ≤6.
Submit the program and graphto Teams. Points in the scatter plot should be in red, the sin function in green, and the ninth-order function in blue.
※The following is a sample of the reference answer. (You do not need to add the word "Sample" to the graph you submit.)
※The solution may differ depending on the environment. 
The upper sample was created with Anaconda. The lower sample was created with Google Colaboratory.
